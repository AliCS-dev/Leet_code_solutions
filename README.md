# ðŸ§® Two Sum Problem â€“ C++ Solution

This repository contains a simple C++ solution for the classic **Two Sum** problem, commonly asked in coding interviews and found on platforms like LeetCode.

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

> Given an array of integers, return the indices of the two numbers that add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

### ðŸ”¢ Example:
```cpp
Input:  arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 9, 8, 10}
